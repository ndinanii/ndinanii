##👋 Hey There! I'm Wonga

A Salesforce Business Analyst & Platform Developer creating human-centered technical solutions from Cape Town, SA.

I don't just build on the Salesforce platform; I translate complex business objectives into scalable, high-ROI assets. My profile is a unique blend of legal rigor and creative systems-thinking, allowing me to bridge the gap between technical teams and business stakeholders with clarity and precision.

##🧠 My "Why"
My path to tech was non-traditional. I found a powerful parallel between my passion for music production and the logic of programming. To me, high-level declarative tools like Flow and the Lightning App Builder are like a digital audio workstation—a user-friendly interface for orchestrating complex underlying logic. This intuitive understanding of "Clicks-as-Code" is at the core of how I build.
